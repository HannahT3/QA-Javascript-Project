# QA-Javascript-Project

## Project Overview
This project involved creating a webpage which enables the user to create, read, update and delete employee information.  The purpose of this project was to draw together HTML, CSS and JavaScript learnt during the QA Academy and produce a functioning application.


## Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li> Microsoft Visual Studio Code (or equivalent) where HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be used and executed </li>.
  <li> The Live Server extension, so that changes on the webpage can be viewed </li>.
  
</ul>
  

## Process
The HTML code was the first thing to be created, so that the structure of the webpage was clear.  This allowed the JavaScript to be created followed by the CSS to alter the appearance.

## Conclusion
The webpage includes all of the requirements and functions as it should.  There were some challenges along the process, including issues with a dropdown box which was replaced with an input box to avoid the error.

To improve this project, the code could be made more concise, with similar methods being refactored to reduce repitions within code (for example, the viewEmployees() and filterByDepartment()).

## Notable Mentions
Special thanks to QA trainers Aswene Sivaraj, Morgan Walsh, Cameron Guthrie and Edsel Tham for teaching the course and their support and coding skills throughout.
